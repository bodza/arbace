/**
 * An annotation expressing that objects and/or their fields are
 * expected to encounter memory contention, generally in the form of
 * "false sharing". This annotation serves as a hint that such objects
 * and fields should reside in locations isolated from those of other
 * objects or fields. Susceptibility to memory contention is a
 * property of the intended usages of objects and fields, not their
 * types or qualifiers. The effects of this annotation will nearly
 * always add significant space overhead to objects. The use of
 * {@code @Contended} is warranted only when the performance impact of
 * this time/space tradeoff is intrinsically worthwhile; for example,
 * in concurrent contexts in which each instance of the annotated
 * class is often accessed by a different thread.
 *
 * A {@code @Contended} field annotation may optionally include a
 * <i>contention group</i> tag. A contention group defines a set of one
 * or more fields that collectively must be isolated from all other
 * contention groups. The fields in the same contention group may not be
 * pairwise isolated. With no contention group tag (or with the default
 * empty tag: "") each {@code @Contended} field resides in its own
 * <i>distinct</i> and <i>anonymous</i> contention group.
 *
 * When the annotation is used at the class level, the effect is
 * equivalent to grouping all the declared fields not already having the
 * {@code @Contended} annotation into the same anonymous group.
 * With the class level annotation, implementations may choose different
 * isolation techniques, such as isolating the entire object, rather than
 * isolating distinct fields. A contention group tag has no meaning
 * in a class level {@code @Contended} annotation, and is ignored.
 *
 * The class level {@code @Contended} annotation is not inherited and has
 * no effect on the fields declared in any sub-classes. The effects of all
 * {@code @Contended} annotations, however, remain in force for all
 * subclass instances, providing isolation of all the defined contention
 * groups. Contention group tags are not inherited, and the same tag used
 * in a superclass and subclass, represent distinct contention groups.
