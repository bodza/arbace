/**
 * Base class for jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe-based FieldAccessors for fields with
 * final or volatile qualifiers. These differ from unqualified
 * versions in that (1) they check for read-only status (2) they use
 * the volatile forms of Unsafe get/put methods. (When accessed via
 * reflection, finals act as slightly "lighter" forms of volatiles. So
 * the volatile forms are heavier than necessary in terms of
 * underlying reordering rules and memory barriers, but preserve
 * correctness.)
