/**
 * A random number generator isolated to the current thread.  Like the
 * global {@link java.util.Random} generator used by the {@link
 * java.lang.Math} class, a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is initialized
 * with an internally generated seed that may not otherwise be
 * modified. When applicable, use of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} rather
 * than shared {@code Random} objects in concurrent programs will
 * typically encounter much less overhead and contention.  Use of
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is particularly appropriate when multiple
 * tasks use random numbers in parallel in thread pools.
 *
 * Usages of this class should typically be of the form:
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextX(...)} (where
 * {@code X} is {@code Int}, {@code Long}, etc).
 * When all usages are of this form, it is never possible to
 * accidentally share a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} across multiple threads.
 *
 * This class also provides additional commonly used bounded random
 * generation methods.
 */
public class ThreadLocalRandom extends Random {
    /*
     * This class implements the java.util.Random API (and subclasses
     * Random) using a single static instance that accesses random
     * number state held in class Thread (primarily, field
     * threadLocalRandomSeed). In doing so, it also provides a home
     * for managing package-private utilities that rely on exactly the
     * same state as needed to maintain the ThreadLocalRandom
     * instances. We leverage the need for an initialization flag
     * field to also use it as a "probe" -- a self-adjusting thread
     * hash used for contention avoidance, as well as a secondary
     * simpler (xorShift) random seed that is conservatively used to
     * avoid otherwise surprising users by hijacking the
     * ThreadLocalRandom sequence.  The dual use is a marriage of
     * convenience, but is a simple and efficient way of reducing
     * application-level overhead and footprint of most concurrent
     * programs. Even more opportunistically, we also define here
     * other package-private utilities that access Thread class
     * fields.
     *
     * Because this class is in a different package than class Thread,
     * field access methods use Unsafe to bypass access control rules.
     * To conform to the requirements of the Random superclass
     * constructor, the common static ThreadLocalRandom maintains an
     * "initialized" field for the sake of rejecting user calls to
     * setSeed while still allowing a call from constructor.  Note
     * that serialization is completely unnecessary because there is
     * only a static singleton.  But we generate a serial form
     * containing "rnd" and "initialized" fields to ensure
     * compatibility across versions.
