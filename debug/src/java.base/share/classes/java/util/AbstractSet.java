 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@code Set}

 *
 * The process of implementing a set by extending this class is identical
 * to that of implementing a Collection by extending AbstractCollection,
 * except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this
 * class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the {@code Set}
 * interface (for instance, the add method must not permit addition of
 * multiple instances of an object to a set).
 *
 * Note that this class does not override any of the implementations from
 * the {@code AbstractCollection} class.  It merely adds implementations
 * for {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}.
 *
 * This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
