/**
 * This class provides skeletal implementations of some {@link Queue}
 * operations. The implementations in this class are appropriate when
 * the base implementation does <em>not</em> allow {@code null}
 * elements.  Methods {@link #add add}, {@link #remove remove}, and
 * {@link #element element} are based on {@link #offer offer}, {@link
 * #poll poll}, and {@link #peek peek}, respectively, but throw
 * exceptions instead of indicating failure via {@code false} or
 * {@code null} returns.
 *
 * A {@code Queue} implementation that extends this class must
 * minimally define a method {@link Queue#offer} which does not permit
 * insertion of {@code null} elements, along with methods {@link
 * Queue#peek}, {@link Queue#poll}, {@link Collection#size}, and
 * {@link Collection#iterator}.  Typically, additional methods will be
 * overridden as well.  If these requirements cannot be met, consider
 * instead subclassing {@link AbstractCollection}.
 *
 * This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
