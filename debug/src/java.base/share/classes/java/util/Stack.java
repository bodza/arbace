/**
 * The {@code Stack} class represents a last-in-first-out
 * (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class {@code Vector} with five
 * operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual
 * {@code push} and {@code pop} operations are provided, as well as a
 * method to {@code peek} at the top item on the stack, a method to test
 * for whether the stack is {@code empty}, and a method to {@code search}
 * the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
 *
 * When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
 *
 * A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is
 * provided by the {@link Deque} interface and its implementations, which
 * should be used in preference to this class.  For example:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();}</pre>
