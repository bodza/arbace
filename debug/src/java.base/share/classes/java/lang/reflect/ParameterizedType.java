 * reflective method, as specified in this package. When a
 * parameterized type p is created, the generic type declaration that
 * p instantiates is resolved, and all type arguments of p are created
 * recursively. See {@link java.lang.reflect.TypeVariable
 * TypeVariable} for details on the creation process for type
 * variables. Repeated creation of a parameterized type has no effect.
 *
 * Instances of classes that implement this interface must implement
 * an equals() method that equates any two instances that share the
 * same generic type declaration and have equal type parameters.
