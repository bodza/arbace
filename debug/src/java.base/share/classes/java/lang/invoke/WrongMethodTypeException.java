/**
 * Thrown to indicate that code has attempted to call a method handle

 *
 * This exception may also be thrown when two method handles are
 * composed, and the system detects that their types cannot be
 * matched up correctly.  This amounts to an early evaluation
 * of the type mismatch, at method handle construction time,
 * instead of when the mismatched method handle is called.
